# DevOps Bootcamp Exercise: Build Tools and Package Managers

## Overview
This document describes the setup, modification, and execution steps for a Java project, covering cloning, error handling, testing, and running the application.

## Steps
1. **Clone and Create Repo:** Cloned the project from a source repository and created a new Git repository for ongoing modifications.
2. **Build Jar Artifact:** Initially faced a compile error due to incorrect test scripts. Corrected this to proceed.
3. **Run Tests:** Fixed a boolean issue in the test scripts using `gradle test` to confirm all tests were passing.
4. **Clean and Build:** After fixing tests, cleaned the project with `gradle clean` and successfully rebuilt the jar.
5. **Start Application:** Launched the application with `java -jar build/libs/app-1.0.jar` to ensure proper execution.
6. **Modify and Re-run with Parameters:** Enhanced functionality to accept two runtime parameters, rebuilt the jar, and tested the new setup.

## Conclusion
Successfully managed project challenges and enhanced functionality, documenting each step for future reference and troubleshooting.
